An abstract class has a constructor which prints "This is constructor of abstract class", an abstract method named '
a_method' and a non-abstract method which prints "This is a normal method of abstract class". A class 'SubClass'
inherits the abstract class and has a method named 'a_method' which prints "This is abstract method". Now create an
object of 'SubClass' and call the abstract method and the non-abstract method. (Analyse the result)
