Create a Student class with name, age, studentId, and email fields. Implement the equals() method to check all fields
except the studentId. Implement the hashCode() method to use all fields except the studentId to calculate the hash code.
Test that two instances with the same name, age, and email return true for equals() and have the same hash code.
