Challenge
Create an Animal class with sound() method that prints to console “animal makes sounds”
Create a Dog class that extends Animal and overrides sound() method; dogs make a particular sound, so we want to print
“bark”, in this case
Create a Cat class that extends Animal and overrides sound() method, and in this case, we want to print in our method
“meow”
Create a Wolf class that extends Animal, and overrides sound() method, and print “how”
Create a TestAnimal Class with a main method, create objects with each animal class created (dog, cat, wolf) and call
sound()
